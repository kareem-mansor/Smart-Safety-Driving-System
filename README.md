# AI-Powered Driver Monitoring System 🚗💡

## 📌 Project Overview
This **AI-powered driver monitoring system** enhances road safety by detecting **seizures and drowsiness** in real time using **computer vision models**. The system integrates with vehicles, triggering an emergency stop when a seizure or drowsiness is detected, preventing potential accidents.

## 🌟 Key Features
✅ **Epileptic Seizure Detection**: Identifies abnormal head movements using deep learning.
✅ **Drowsiness Detection**: Tracks eye closure and fatigue signs to detect drowsiness.
✅ **Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses computer vision to continuously monitor driver behavior.
✅ **Emergency Response System**: Connects with a mobile application to trigger an emergency stop.
✅ **Enhanced Safety**: Provides real-time alerts to prevent accidents and ensure driver well-being.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍 - Core programming language
- **Deep Learning** 🧠 - Used for seizure and drowsiness detection
- **OpenCV** 🎥 - Computer vision for real-time monitoring
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🔥 - Deep learning framework
- **Mobile Application (Flutter/Android)** 📱 - Interface for driver alerts and vehicle communication
- **IoT Integration** 🌐 - Connects with the vehicle for emergency response

## 🔴 Challenges Faced
🔹 **Accurate Seizure & Drowsiness Detection**: Training robust models to minimize false positives.
🔹 **Real-Time Processing**: Optimizing model inference speed for immediate response.
🔹 **Vehicle Integration**: Ensuring smooth communication between the AI system and the vehicle.
